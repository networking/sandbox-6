Menu items can be organized hierarchically, drag and drop them to create the structure you like. You can build multiple levels of menu items and nest them freely. The URL does not change if you move a<\/span><span style=\"line-height:1.6em\"> menu item to another place in your menu tree (the URL<\/span><span style=\"line-height:1.6em\"> is defined by the URL of the page, or the URL entered in the external\/internal URL setting of the menu item).<\/p>\n\n                    <p><strong>Menu Item Name<\/strong><br \/>\n                    The Name of a menu item can be any string of your choice. If you like you can use the same term as for the page name it links to, but you can also name it anything else.
